Many of my projects are private as they are based off of class assignments, or were made prior to me using this GitHub account.

I mainly code with Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript, but I'm currently learning F# to dip my toes into more functional programming languages. Newer F# projects will be published here as they come along.
